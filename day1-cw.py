# A juice shop sells three types of drinks: apple, orange, and grape. You are asked to calculate the total volume of juice sold in one day.
# The shop sold:
# 15.5 liters of apple juice
# 20 liters of orange juice
# 10.25 liters of grape juice
# Your task:
# Store the volume of each juice in separate variables.
# Calculate the total volume sold.
# Print the total volume.
# Convert the total volume to an integer and print it.
# Convert the total volume to a string and print it with a message.
# Add a random number between 5 and 10 (representing additional bonus liters) and print the final total
import random

a = 15.5
b = 20
c = 10.25

total = a + b + c
print(total)
print(int(total))
print(f'The total volume of juice sold is: {str(total)}')
total += random.randrange(5,10)
print(total)
