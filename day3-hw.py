# You are working on a basic status checker for a web application. Complete the following steps:

# Declare two Boolean variables: is_logged_in = True and is_subscribed = False.
# Initialize user_credits = 100, max_credits = 200, and min_credits = 50.
# Check if user_credits is within the valid range (greater than or equal to min_credits and less than or equal to max_credits) and not equal to min_credits. Store the result in credits_valid.
# Check if the user is eligible for bonus credits: the user is eligible if they are either subscribed or have credits greater than min_credits. Use the or and not operators. Store the result in bonus_eligible.
# Modify user_credits using the following operators: += (add 50), -= (subtract 20), *= (multiply by 2), and %= (modulo 150). Store the final value in user_credits.
# Compute the square of the final user_credits and store it in power_result.
# Use a logical operator to check if the user is both logged in and subscribed. Store the result in full_access.
# Use an identity operator to check if is_logged_in is exactly True. Store the result in is_true_login.
# Demonstrate operator precedence with the expression: access_result = is_logged_in or is_subscribed and False.
# Print the following results: is_logged_in, is_subscribed, credits_valid, bonus_eligible, user_credits, power_result, full_access, is_true_login, and access_result.
